# Problems to solve

Below are all tags, and what is being expected to be done.

### V1.0 - Starting with unit tests
1. Implement the Auctioneer class. This class must have a method evaluates (Auction auction), which holds the highest and lowest value of bids placed in that auction. Then write at least one unit test for this class.

2. Implement in the Auctioneer class a method that returns the average value of bids. Also write test for this.
