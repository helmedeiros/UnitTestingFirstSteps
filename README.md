First steps for TDD learners

These project is part of the PM-71 course by Caelum.

Can you see any logical problem? The tests are covering all possible scenarios? FORK IT! AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS :)

# Problems to solve

Below are all tags, and what is being expected to be done.

### V1.0 - Starting with unit tests
1. Implement the Auctioneer class. This class must have a method evaluates (Auction auction), which holds the highest and lowest value of bids placed in that auction. Then write at least one unit test for this class.

2. Implement in the Auctioneer class a method that returns the average value of bids. Also write test for this.

### V2.0 - Problems to solve

1. Write the test to ensure that the class Evaluator works if the auction has only one Lance. To do so, create an auction bid only (with a value of, for example, 600), and invoking the Auctioneer. To validate, verify that both the highest and the lowest being equal to 600.
